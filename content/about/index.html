<p>I have a reddish-brown fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a waddling gait due to my shorter front legs; Iâ€™m roughly the size of a domestic cat, though with a longer body.
I live in trees and feed mainly on bamboo, but I also eat eggs, birds, and insects.</p>
<p>I joined the IUCN Endangered species red list in 2008 as a result of a constant population decline caused by habitat loss, poaching and inbreed depression.</p>
<p>For more information, you can take a look at my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_panda_">Wikipedia page</a></p>
